			<h3>About Brigitte</h3>
			<p>Brigitte is a support who functions a little bit like a second tank. 
			She has a personal shield, and her primary weapon is a close ranged mace. 
			The most important part about playing Brigitte is her passive, which is 
			Inspire. When Brigitte his an opponent with a primary mace hit or with 
			a whip shot, she procs her Inspire, which heals all teammates around you 
			at a low, but consistant rate. She is definitely a sustain support, and 
			her main utility is being a strong presence and displacing opponents with 
			her whip shot. I tend to switch to Brigitte when I am being heavily targeted 
			while playing Ana, or when my fellow support selects Ana so that I can 
			play a sort of body guard for her.</p>

			<h3>Brigitte's Abilities</h3>
			<div class="abilities">
				<button type="button" class="alert button expanded" data-toggle="repair-pack">Sleep Dart</button>
				<div class="dropdown-pane" id="repair-pack" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true">
					<p>Sleep dart is incredibly useful, as it is one of the remaining forms of true CC in the game 
					since the purge when Overwatch 2 released. The ability to remove an opponent from the match for 5 seconds 
					is unbelievably valuable. This can be used against a tank to dive their backline, to defend yourself 
					when you are being dived, or even to counter ultimates like Reaper's Death Blossom. Landing sleeps will 
					bring your team an incredible amount of value and it is essential that you get familiar with this tool.</p>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="success button expanded" data-toggle="whip-shot">Anti-Nade</button>
				<div class="dropdown-pane" id="whip-shot" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true">
					<p>Anti-Nade is your most powerful fight-winning tool. You throw a grenade that splashes the 
					enemies and teammates around it. The teammates are healed an instant 100 health and receive 
					bonus healing for 3 seconds, AND the opponents are dealt 60 damage and cannot be healed for 3 
					seconds. This is incredible for earning kills and assists since the opponents will be greatly 
					softened up for your team to dive. It also has a potential 500 instant healing, and still boosts 
					any more potential healing you may need! Deciding when and how to use this ability is the defining 
					game-decider with Ana.</p>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="simple button expanded" data-toggle="nano">Nano Boost</button>
				<div class="dropdown-pane" id="nano" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true">
					<p>Nano is Ana's ultimate. It instantly heals the target 250 health, halves incoming damage to 
					that target, and increases their damage dealt by 50%. This ability supercharges a teammate for 
					incredible plays. This is often saved for either the tank or a specific DPS that synergizes well 
					with it (an example is Genji with his ultimate, known by the community as Nanoblade). It can also 
					be used on anyone to give them a second chance at life.</p>
