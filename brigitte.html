			<h3>About Brigitte</h3>
			<p>Brigitte is a support who functions a little bit like a second tank. 
			She has a personal shield, and her primary weapon is a close ranged mace. 
			The most important part about playing Brigitte is her passive, which is 
			Inspire. When Brigitte his an opponent with a primary mace hit or with 
			a whip shot, she procs her Inspire, which heals all teammates around you 
			at a low, but consistant rate. She is definitely a sustain support, and 
			her main utility is being a strong presence and displacing opponents with 
			her whip shot. I tend to switch to Brigitte when I am being heavily targeted 
			while playing Ana, or when my fellow support selects Ana so that I can 
			play a sort of body guard for her.</p>

			<h3>Brigitte's Abilities (Hover to See!)</h3>
			<div class="abilities">
				<button type="button" class="alert button expanded" data-toggle="repair-pack">Sleep Dart</button>
				<div class="dropdown-pane" id="repair-pack" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true">
					<p>Reapair Pack is Brigitte's way to heal her allies when Inspire is not active. It heals a teammate 
					110 health over 2 seconds. Since you only have 3 of these and they are fairly weak heals, it is all 
					the more important that you keep Inspire active.</p>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="success button expanded" data-toggle="whip-shot">Anti-Nade</button>
				<div class="dropdown-pane" id="whip-shot" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true">
					<p>Whip Shot is a very basic ability. It allows Brigitte to swing her mace a long distance. It deals 
					75 damage, boops back the enemy, and triggers Inspire. Using this off cooldown can be effective, though 
					sometimes you want to keep it up to play defense or dislodge an opponent from high ground.</p>
				</div>
				<button type="button" class="simple button expanded" data-toggle="rally">Nano Boost</button>
				<div class="dropdown-pane" id="rally" data-dropdown data-hover="true" data-hover-pane="true">
					<p>Rally is Brigitte's ultimate. It is being changed significantly in Season 4, so I will give the 
					updated stats instead of the current ones. Rally does several things. It gives the Brigitte player a 
					700 health shield, allows her shield bash to stun opponents, and gives her extra armor that regenerates. 
					It also builds up 100 overhealth to allies that regenerates as long as Rally is active. It is a 
					sustain ultimate that turns Brigitte into a miniature raid boss.</p>

			<h3>Brigitte's Pain Points (Click for More Info!)</h3>
			
			<ul class="vertical menu accordion-menu" data-accordion-menu>
				<li>
					<a href="#" class="redvisited">Passivity</a>
					<ul class="menu vertical nested">
						<li><a href="#">Brigitte will sometimes have to play extremely passive. Professional Brigitte 
						players average around 25% Inspire uptime, which means they spend 75% of their time not passively 
						healing their team!</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Remember, you are more valuable alive with low healing than dead with no healing. 
						Only proc Inspire when you are reasonably sure it is safe to do so.</a></li>
					</ul>
				<li>
				<li>
					<a href="#" class="redvisited">Whip Shot Usage</a>
					<ul class="menu vertical nested">
						<li><a href="#">Though whip shot is a simple ability, using it can be tricky. The most common use 
						is simply to proc your Inspire.</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">Sometimes, though, countering a diving Winston/D.Va or booping away an ulting character 
						is a more valuable target.</a></li>
