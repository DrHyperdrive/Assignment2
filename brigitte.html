			<h3>About Brigitte</h3>
			<p>Brigitte is a support who functions a little bit like a second tank. 
			She has a personal shield, and her primary weapon is a close ranged mace. 
			The most important part about playing Brigitte is her passive, which is 
			Inspire. When Brigitte his an opponent with a primary mace hit or with 
			a whip shot, she procs her Inspire, which heals all teammates around you 
			at a low, but consistant rate. She is definitely a sustain support, and 
			her main utility is being a strong presence and displacing opponents with 
			her whip shot. I tend to switch to Brigitte when I am being heavily targeted 
			while playing Ana, or when my fellow support selects Ana so that I can 
			play a sort of body guard for her.</p>
