			<h3>About Ana</h3>
			<p>Ana is a support sniper. Her biotic rifle heals teammates and damages enemies and 
			damages enemies. In a duel against Widowmaker, the DPS sniper of this game, Ana lost 
			her right eye. This is demonstrated in game through the fact that Ana cannot headshot, 
			her healing and damage are exactly 75, regardless of where you hit your teammate or 
			opponent. Understanding this is very important, since it removes the need to be as 
			precise as a DPS sniper. Your primary job is to heal teammates and take shots on the 
			enemy. Since your damage is so consistent, you can get kills more often than most 
			supports. The majority of the cast will always die after three shots.
